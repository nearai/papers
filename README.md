## Proof of Response

We present a mechanism that for a network of participants allows one participant of the network (Alice) to request some data from another participant (Bob) and either receive a response from Bob within a known-in-advance, bounded time b, or receive a proof that at least one edge on the way to Bob was broken within b, or receive a streaming payment proportional to time passed beyond b during which neither was received.

This mechanism allows for building downstream applications that require provable responses from other participants, such as decentralized storage solutions, decentralized AI agents, and more.
